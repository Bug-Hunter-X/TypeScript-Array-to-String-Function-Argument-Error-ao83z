# TypeScript Array to String Function Argument Error

This example demonstrates a common error in TypeScript when passing an array to a function expecting a string argument.  The code attempts to pass an array of strings to the `greeter` function, which only accepts a single string. This results in a runtime error.

The solution involves modifying the function signature to handle arrays or making sure that only a single string is passed to the function.
